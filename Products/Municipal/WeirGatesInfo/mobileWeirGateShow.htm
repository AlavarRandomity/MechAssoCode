    <p style="font-size: 15px; width: 50%; margin-bottom: 20px;">Weir gates are used in a variety of applications from municipal to agriculture to control/maintain the water level on one side of the gate while allowing water
      to flow over the top of the slide. Weir gates can also be referred to as downward opening slide gates because the movement of the slide is in a downward direction to open the gate and can be manufactured with a
      four sided seal essentially identical to our standard upward opening slide gate. Mechanical Associates fabricated weir gates are built to engineered specifications per project. Sizes range from 3&#148;x3&#148; up to 240&#148;x240&#148;.
      We also offer our standard gate sizes that are designed for 10 feet of on and off-seating head pressures. Both the FC-SS and the UHO-10-AL series can be designed for any installation method and seal configuration.
      For a complete listing of applications and configurations download the product brochure. Mechanical associates can also custom engineer any gate to meet our customer&#039;s needs.
